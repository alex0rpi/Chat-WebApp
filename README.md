# Chat-WebApp üíªüñ•

This is a web chat that uses SocketIO to communicate between clients and server. It also uses ReactJS for the frontend and NodeJS for the backend.

## Personal note üìùüôçüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This project constitutes the final project of a Backend Nodejs bootcamp that I did at the Barcelona Cibern@rium (https://cibernarium.barcelonactiva.cat/). This project allowed me to throw myself into the pool and try many different technologies, almost entirely in Typescript, which is quite new to me. I would lie If I said that I didn't struggle. Every technology gave me its own headaches. To mention a few difficulties I had:

- Set up the sequelize models in typescript.
- Decide how many tables should the db have.
- Manage routing in react.
- Decide where and how to set the event emitters and listeners in the react frontend.
- Setup the context in react and what to store there.
- Setup the first event emitters and listeners in the socket context to connect at the start and listen for the socketIO server reply and update the context accordingly.
- Ended up using quite a few of useStates (e.g. for rooms, messages, loggedUser etc.). At some point I wasn't sure what to store in the context, so the app has a mix of both. At least I think it was beneficial for learning purposes but I'm sure there are better practices to apply.
- I big wall I hit was to figure how to avoid sending messages everywhere and keep them segregated for each room and also make sure a user can talk alone in a room without others knowing. I thought I could solve it using some conditions on react side but what did the trick was to use additional socketIO functionalities like .join(), .leave() and .to(roomName) to be more precise about where the users are connected and where should the messages be targetted from the server side.

## Working principles of this chat üìù

The chat is a web application that allows users to create rooms and chat with other users in real time.

- First users must register
- After registering they are redirected to the welcome chat where the input msg is autofocused and they can start chatting with other users in that room.
- Users can create new rooms by writting a name in the newRoom input above the room list.
- After that they can just click on the new generated room button in the room list and they will be redirected to that room, where they can chat with other users in that room.
- A user can ONLY BE AT ONE ROOM AT A TIME. Meaning, once he/she goes to a different room, it will be socket-disconnected from the previous one, and socket-joined to the next one.</br><hr>
  
  __What the app doesn't allow__ (at least for now)__:__
* _Open private conversation with other users._ Since all rooms are public to all registered users.
* _Send files or pictures._
* _Delete rooms._ </br>

## Installation üì¶

- Clone the repository on your local machine using the command git clone.
- Open two terminals to be able to execute client and server side at the same time.
- Terminal 1: cd client and then npm i. Then npm run dev to run the frontend.
- Terminal 2: cd server and then npm i.
- On server side, create a config.env file inside the /config folder. It will contain the environment variables that you need to set up for the databse in order \* to run the server. You can use the .env.example file as a template.
- Make sure you fill correctly the variables in the config.env file, otherwise the server won't run. Put a correct mysql username (MYSQL_USER) and password \* (MYSQL_PWD), and a correct database name (MYSQL_NAME). You can change the PORT if you want.
- npm start to run the backend.
- Open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.
- Have funüéäüéâ

## Improvement opportunities üìà

Although I believe I've achieved the desired functional result and fulfilled most of the bootcamp requirements, there is significant room for improvement for this app. To mention a few potential improvements:

- The app should be dockerized. I'm still learning how to use docker and docker-compose.
- I wasn't able to configure the sequelize models in typescript. That's why these are the only pure javascript files in the project. Ideally, these files at well could've been implemented in typescript.
- Implement a more robust error handling and validation system. Mine here is still quite basic.
- Study the implementation of hexagonal architecture. At least in the backend.
- Client side is rather simplistic, so it could be improved as well. Adding framer motion animations would be a nice touch.
- At the moment the rooms can only be created but not deleted. This could be a nice feature to add and manage whether there are users in that in a room to be deleted or not.
- Users don't have a profile picture nor can send files or pictures. Multer could be used to implement this feature.
- Also, once registered, users are permanently stored on the db. It would be nice to implement a feature so users can delete their accounts.
  These are just a few enhancements that I can think of right now. I'm sure there are many more. Feel free to contribute to this project if you want to.
